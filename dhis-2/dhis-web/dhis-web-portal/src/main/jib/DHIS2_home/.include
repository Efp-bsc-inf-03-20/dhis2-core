# Used to create parent folder structure by Jib
# /DHIS2_home is added for backwards-compatibility with Docker images created before we used Jib
# So that tools like d2 can create DHIS2 containers of images created with and without Jib
# Pre-Jib images created /DHIS2_home with permissions for DHIS2 to write to it
# /DHIS2_home will be removed once DHIS2 2.38 is EOL
